# Fresh works  Assignment

### Problem Statement

Build a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, delete) operations.
This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop.
This data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work with the data store.

### Use

1. Create a NetBeans project
2. In libraries , add FreshWorks-FileBased-Key-Store.jar and json-simple-1.1.1.jar files.
3. Import FileBasedStore to use CRD operations as mentioned in the functional requirements.
4. Import JSONObject to make use of JSONObject data.
